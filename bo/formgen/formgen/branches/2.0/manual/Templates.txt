Chapter: Element templates

Section: Usage

Each special element bases its display on a template. These template files are found in the templates/ directory.
Normally, each template will have a filename of *element name*.html.

The template files contain plain text, with a few placeholders to indicate where the element's values are placed,
and where error messages may be placed.

Element variables are placed with the syntax *{$varname}*. See each specific element for which variables are
available, and what their meaning is. Any unplaced errors that are encountered within variable contents can
be forced to be placed in a specific error position within the current template by following the name
with :error=*name* (e.g. {$input:error=er1}).

To place errors, insert *{#error}* into the template. These error positions can be given a name by follwing the
word 'error' with a colon and a name, like {#error:name}. An alternative template can be given by following the
name with another colon and the template variation name, like {#error:name:variation}. {#error::variation} is
also valid, in case just the variation is needed.

Section: Alternative templates

If in certain situations a different template must be used, then alternative templates can be created.
These are created by putting an extra part before the extension. For example, field.alt.html will create an
alternative template for the field tag with name 'alt'.
