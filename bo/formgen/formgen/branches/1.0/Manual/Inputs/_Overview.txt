Chapter: Inputs

Section: Introduction

The form generator implements a different way of specifying HTML inputs. This method
allows specifying validations checks on inputs, and it can also draw information
from properties defined in an <Object description>.

Section: Common attributes and tags
A few settings are common for all input tags. First, the type of an input is
given in its *type* attribute, and this attribute is required. See the various
descriptions of the input types for their type string. An input's name should be
given by the *id* attribute, not the name attribute. This id must be unique in the
form, and must be specified. The default value for an input can be given in the
*default* attribute. Finally, entering a value in the input can be made required
by specifying the *required* attribute with any value. Note that it is still not
required to fill in the input if it is within a condition that is false.

Any attributes other than the ones listed above will be present in the HTML
generated for the input.

<Checks> can be associated with inputs by placing check tags within the input
tag. See that section for how to use them.

Inputs with a limited set of options (such as radio buttons and dropdowns) require
their values to be specified in <value> tags. These tags are placed inside the
input tag. A value tag has one required attribute, *value*. This specifies the
internally used value. The content of the value tag is its caption. Some tags
allow full HTML to be given as a caption, others only allow plain strings.
