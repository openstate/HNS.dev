Chapter: Setting up

Setting up the form generator requires three simple steps.

Obtaining the generator:
To get the generator, check out the repository at http://host27.griv.nl/repos/formgen/gen. The full
repos is just the /formgen, but this also includes the generated documentation which is not required.

Configuring the generator:
Create a PHP file, which defines an array $settings. This array contains the generator's settings,
and must be set to proper values for the project. The settings are described in
<DirTraverser::__construct>, but copied here for convenience.

baseDir     - The directory at which to start scanning.
fileMask    - The filemask that identifies form definition files.
classDir    - The directory relative to the form file where class files will be written.
className   - The name of the generated classes. The filenames are based on this as well.
htmlDir     - The directory relative to the form file where HTML files will be written.
htmlHeadDir - The directory relative to the form file where HTML header files will be written. If not specified,
              the header will be written in the normal HTML file.
actionTarget - The file that the form will be submitted to.
actionDir   - The directory relative to the form file where action files will be written.
actionFiles - An array of files that perform display and/or actions. The key is the name of the PHP template file,
							the value is the name of the generated file.
templateDir - The directory where the PHP templates can be found.

The generated filenames classFile, actionFiles and actionTarget have a
few format specifiers:

%O - The object name as specified in a form template.
%o - The object name with the first letter converted to lowercase.
%A - The action name starting with a capital.
%a - The action name starting with a lowercase letter.

Running the generator:
Either open the index file via Apache, or run it from the command line. For the Apache call,
the get-parameter 'settings' should be given specifying the location of the settings file to
use, on the command line the first parameter specifies that file.

Generated files:
For each form description within a description file, a number of files are generated. These are:
- A HTML template for displaying. If 'htmlHeadDir' is given, a second HTML file will be generated
  that contains HTML to be included inside the <head> tag.
- A PHP base class that manages the form input, performs validation, etc.
- A PHP subclass in which custom code can be written. When regenerating code, this file is not
  overwritten.
- A small PHP file that calls the managing class.
