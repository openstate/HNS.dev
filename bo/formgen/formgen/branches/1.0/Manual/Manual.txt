The form generator is a tool written to ease the creation of HTML forms. Normally, writing a form
requires a lot of repetitive actions in order to write the HTML template and the associated
display and action scripts. For forms that manage entries in a database, this is often worse
since both a create and an update form must be written and maintained separately, although
generally these forms will be nearly identical. For each form, a set of validation checks
must also be written, together with generating the correct error messages. Things such as
client-side validation are generally not considered, due to the extra effort involved in
writing and maintaining essentially double code. The form generator aims to reduce maintenance
of both simple and complex forms, while maintaning high flexibility.
