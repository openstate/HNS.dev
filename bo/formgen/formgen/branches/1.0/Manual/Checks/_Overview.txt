Chapter: Validation checks

Section: Introduction

Checks specify conditions that values entered into their associated inputs must adhere
to. If a value fails a check, form submission will have failed and the user is
presented with an error message.

A check is specified with a <check> tag, which has one required attribute, *type*.
This specifies what check to use. See the descriptions for the checks what value
to enter here.

Some check types may have options, and these options are given through <option>
tags within the check tag. An option tag has a required attribute *name*, which
gives the name of the option to set, and the option tag's value gives the value
of the option. See the individual check documentation for a list of their options.

Section: List of checks

Below is a list of all checks, and a short description of their function.

Equal - (<Equal check>)	Requires a value to match the value of another input.
Regex - (<Regex check>) Requires a value to match a regular expression.
