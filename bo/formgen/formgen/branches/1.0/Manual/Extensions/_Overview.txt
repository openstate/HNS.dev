Chapter: Extension tags

Section: Introduction

Extension tags are tags which have specific code written to parse them. They tend to
represent larger structures in forms and can be used to specify a form more in
terms of structure instead of writing a lot of HTML by hand.

Section: List of extensions

Below is a list of all checks, and a short description of their function.
Each detailed description will list the tag template's placeholders as well, or
give a note that a template is not used for the tag.
