Chapter: Field tag

This tag represents an input field with an associated label. It can be used in several
ways.

Subsubsection: Linked to a property
Most commonly, a field will be linked to a property to generate a caption/input control field
in the form. In this method, two attributes must be specified: *property* and *type*.
Property holds the name of the property to link to, and type gives the input type used.
A default for the input can be given in an optional attribute *default*. The field tag
is empty in this use.

Subsubsection: Linked to a property, custom controls
This is similar to a normal property link, but used when a more complex interface is
required. In this case, the *type* attribute is set to 'custom', and the content of the
field tag may contain any HTML that is used to fill the input part. The *default* attribute
is not applicable in this case.

Subsubsection: Custom values
For fields that have no linked property, the *property* attribute is absent. Instead,
two child tags of the field tag, <label> and <value> contain the HTML used to create
the field.

Subsubsection: Template placeholders
label - The caption of the input.
value - The HTML of the input itself.
