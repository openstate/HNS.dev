Chapter: Columns tag

This tag represents a list of values in a table structure, with a column for each
type of value.

Subsubsection: Use
The columns tag itself does not have any attributes. Within the <columns> tag,
<column> tags define a single column. These column tags work similarly to
<Field tags>: using an attribute *property* links them to a specified property,
while not specifying this attribute allows the use of the child tags <label>
and <value>. Since no input types are generated, the attribute *type* is not
present.

A message to be given when there are no items to list can be given in the
tag <empty>, which is placed within the <columns> tag. The contents of this
tag is the HTML for one row to be displayed.

Subsubsection: Template placeholders
header   - The headers for all the columns
elements - The HTML for all of the rows in the list.

This extension tag requires a few more templates to be specified.

colhead:
The template for a single column header.

colrow:
The template for a single row with values. This is not used for the column header.

row - The row to be contained.

colvalue:
The template for a single column value.

value - The contents of the column.
